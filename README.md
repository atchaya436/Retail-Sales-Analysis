# RETAIL SALES ANALYSIS USING POWER BI
## Introduction
In this project, I have developed a Retail Sales dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze key business metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, and customer insights. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and modeling to create an efficient analytical structure. Interactive visuals like charts, slicers, and drill-throughs were implemented to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance across time. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by providing real-time, easy to understand insights through a professional and user-friendly interface.This project gave me hands-on experience and practical knowledge in data analytics, business intelligence, and dashboard design using Power BI.

## OBJECTIVE
The main objectives are:
1.	Power BI will bridge data from various sources like CSV files, databases, and cloud services.
2.	In Power Query, preview and profile to see missing values, errors, and other data quality problems.
3.	Proceed with proper data cleaning practices. Remove duplicates, handle null or blank rows, deal with column headers, etc.
4.	Proceed with the data transformation processes. Alter datatype, split and merge columns and so on, aggregate, so that your dataset is compiled.
5.	Next, structure the data into a data model (fact and dimension tables) for razoring up to analyze.
6.	To design three report pages - Overview, Customer Analysis, and Product & Time Analysis.
7.	To utilize visualizations (cards, charts, tables and slicers) to present data in an easy to consume format.   
8.	To enable slicer synchronization, drill-through and bookmarks to enable interactivity and navigation.  

## REPORTS
A Power BI report is a collection of one or more pages containing visuals that represent data from a dataset. Power BI report is an interactive data visualization that is created in Microsoft Power BI Desktop or in the Power BI Service. You can visualize your raw data in Power BI reports. They are intended to help you convert raw data into actionable insights, through different types of data visualizations (charts, tables, maps, KPIs, etc). 

## LEARNING OUTCOMES
•	Understand Power BI Reports
•	Design Interactive Reports
•	Use Visualizations Effectively
•	Analyze Data and gain insights
•	Publish and Share Reports

## SUMMARY
This project illustrated the development and publication of an interactive Power BI report that sources analytics on sales and customer data from multiple viewpoints. The report was constructed with three report pages i.e Overview, Customer Analysis, and Product & Time Analysis, to capture a full analysis of overall performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The report leverages a variety of visuals in an effort to create relevant business insights from a raw dataset, such as cards, charts and tables, slicers, scatter plots, and donut charts. Interactivity of the report was enabled by synchronized slicers, drill-throughs, and conditional formatting in order to enhance the dynamic experience and user satisfaction. In the end the report functionality was published to the Power BI Service in order to provide usability, collaboration, and data driven decisions. Throughout the challenges faced during the project, such as data quality, model complexity, and performance optimization, this project will assume its place providing business insights in the Power BI platform, but also documentation establishing Power BI as a viable option for obtaining business intelligence results out of data.
