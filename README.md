# RETAIL SALES ANALYSIS USING POWER BI
## Introduction
In this project, I have developed a Retail Sales dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze key business metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, and customer insights. 
The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and modeling to create an efficient analytical structure. Interactive visuals like charts, slicers, and drill-throughs were implemented to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance across time. 
The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by providing real-time, easy to understand insights through a professional and user-friendly interface.
This project gave me hands-on experience and practical knowledge in data analytics, business intelligence, and dashboard design using Power BI.
